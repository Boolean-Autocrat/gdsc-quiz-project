# Quiz Project using Python

### By Suyash Handa

This is my submission for round 1 of BITS Pilani's GDSC (a quiz project using python). It is a command line application.

## Features

- Class-based, modular design (oop ftw!)
- Skip Questions: Entering anything other than true or false will skip the question (0 points).
- Question Summary: View a summary of your previous answers during the quiz by navigating to the previous questions.
- Random Question Shuffling: Questions are presented in a random order for each quiz session.
- Timer System: Time is tracked for each question, and a point is deducted if you take too long.
- Navigation: Move between questions easily.
- Interactive Interface: User-friendly prompts and clear instructions.
- Color Coding: The program indicate correct, incorrect, and skipped questions.
- Quiz Submission: View your final score and exit gracefully when done.

## How to run
